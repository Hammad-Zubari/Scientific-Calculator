# Scientific-Calculator
A scientific calculator is designed to handle a wide range of mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic. It is a valuable tool for students, engineers, scientists, and professionals who need to perform complex calculations. Here are some of the key features typically found in a scientific calculator:

Key Features of a Scientific Calculator:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: Fundamental operations for everyday calculations.
Advanced Mathematical Functions:

Square Root (âˆš): Computes the square root of a number.
Exponentiation (x^y): Raises a number to a power.
Logarithms (log, ln): Computes logarithms with various bases, including base 10 (common log) and base e (natural log).
Trigonometric Functions:

Sine, Cosine, Tangent: Calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle.
Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Computes the inverse functions, such as arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent.
Hyperbolic Functions: Includes hyperbolic sine (sinh), cosine (cosh), and tangent (tanh).
